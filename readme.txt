Art style: isometric rouguelike, or 2d topdown. leaning towards isometric. pixel art / cell shading, similar to terraria

Basic concept: 
    calm and relaxing game or occasionally terrifying
    mostly looting, easy fights
    personal treasure room to store trophies and loot
    Cost currency to enter the dungeon
    Loot can be sold for a fixed price, so I need a vendor
    Boss rooms can be accessed with special keys (needs to be an intentional fight)
        Bosses will be much harder 
    only way to leave a dungeon is an extraction eagle
    maybe add a gear crafting mechanic??
Little details:
    Lots of inventory space / weight for extended runs in the dungeon
    loot will be dropped from mobs and found in chests
    The farther you go from the start == better loot, or loot just scales with playtime / level
    Lose everything If you die in the dungeon, maybe an insurance system???
    Itâ€™ll be like Tarakov and a Dungeon game combined
    To extract you will need to find or buy bird bait, a giant bird will pick you up	
    entry upgrades can be bought from the store (better loot, weaker enemies, more loot, special quests) 
Types of Monsters:
    almost anything from any mythology
    dugeon could have themes that only allow certain mobs to spawn (greek mythologoy, asian folklore)
    custom loot tables for themed dungeons
    they can eb accessed by finding a theme seal
    rooms in a regular dungeon will be themed randomly
Level generation: (each level is its own screen, not continueous walking) #! not finalized

    combine the outlines of multiple shapes, then distribute the room items (chests, loot, spawners)
    every room will have at least 3 exits 
    minimap will show the layout and room items
    
    OR use Cellular Automata, Preferred
