Art style: 2d isometric rouguelike, or topdown. leaning towards isometric. pixel art / cell shading, similar to terraria

Basic concept: 
    calm and relaxing game or occasionally terrifying
    mostly looting, easy fights
    personal treasure room to store trophies and loot
    Cost currency to enter the dungeon
    Loot can be sold for a fixed price, so I need a vendor
    Boss rooms can be accessed with special keys (needs to be an intentional fight)
        Bosses will be much harder 
    only way to leave a dungeon is an extraction eagle
    maybe add a gear crafting mechanic??
Little details:
    Lots of inventory space / weight for extended runs in the dungeon
    loot will be dropped from mobs and found in chests
    The farther you go from the start == better loot, or loot just scales with playtime / level
    Lose everything If you die in the dungeon, maybe an insurance system???
    Itâ€™ll be like Tarakov and a Dungeon game combined
    To extract you will need to find or buy bird bait, a giant bird will pick you up
